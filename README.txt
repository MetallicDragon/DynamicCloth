This is a demo of a particle-based cloth simulation. This was created and compiled using Visual Studio (2010, I think) for Intro to Game Programming at UC Merced. I include it here as example code.

Run gsimstart.exe to run. All the code except a bit in app_main and app_viewer is my own. The gsim library is not included and thus this code will not compile as-is.
